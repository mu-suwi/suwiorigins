### origins/origin_layers

#### origin
This is the normal origin layer, extending the base one from the Origins mod. Most of our species-specific customizations live here.

#### size
This is a set of secondary powers granted by the growth ray or shrink ray when they alter your character scaling. May be phased out in the future in favor of having the ray grant/revoke powers directly.

#### vore
The dedicated layer for vore-related powers. Accessible via commands or by eating special food items (NYI)

#### global
This is the layer where we put origin powers meant to apply globally to everyone on the server, such as the power that makes creepers treat players like cats.
